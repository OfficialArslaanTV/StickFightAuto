# StickFightAuto
StickFightAuto is a program I wrote in python for all the people who want to auto spam in stick fight. Note: You will have to change the code if you have a custom punch keybind because the default is set to "C". If you don't, you're all set!
** Make sure you install pynput before running the program otherwise it will not work. Install pynput by typing "pip install pynput" in your CMD.
